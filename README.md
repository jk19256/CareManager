# CareManager
This Alexa skill is developed to allow either caregivers or people who need care to coordinate care tasks between them. The skill  allows the user to add people to database table and assign tasks to people in the table. The user will also be able to delete tasks, delete people from the list and resit the table. Any time the user can invoke the skill and ask for the assigned tasks for the invoked person from the table.

This skill is developed as part of a research project for a master of science degree for the University of Bristol.
